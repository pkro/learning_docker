# Learning docker course notes


## Terms

- Docker is NOT a VM
- self contained, sealed unit of software
- contains everything required to run the code including the OS

Container:

- includes code, configs, processes, networking and dependencies, OS

Docker is 
- a client program named docker that is used on the command line
- a server program that manages a linux system

## Using docker

### The docker flow

Image -> `docker run` -> running container -> stopped container

- `docker images` shows images on the system
- `docker run -ti ubuntu:latest` downloads (if necessary) and runs an ubuntu image from dockerhub with with an **i**nteractive **t**erminal
- `docker -ps` shows running containers; the **image and containers IDs are unrelated**

An image is *fixed* and *doesn't change* when doing stuff inside the container. When a container is stopped however, it (and the files created in it) still exist.

- `docker ps -a` shows all containers including stopped ones (Status=exited).
- `docker ps -l` shows the last stopped container.

A container is stopped when the process running inside it is stopped, e.g. when running `docker run -ti ubuntu:latest bash` (bash is the program we want to run in it, though we don't really need `bash` here as it's the default shell and we already indicated we want an interactive terminal), and we exit the bash shell using `exit`, the container is stopped but still exists.

We can restart a stopped container using `docker 

After doing changes in a container (installing software etc), we can use the container to create a new image from it including our changes using `docker commit`.

How to create a new image from a modified container step by step:

    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker run -ti ubuntu
    root@58b52b38371f:/# touch importantfile.txt
    root@58b52b38371f:/# exit
    exit
    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker ps -l
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS                     PORTS     NAMES
    58b52b38371f   ubuntu    "bash"    25 seconds ago   Exited (0) 9 seconds ago             charming_taussig
    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker commit 58b5
    sha256:b2f950146ac5905748cc37496fc0ddc5c4d7732c1cf9495baa596300ba63d5db
    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker tag b2f950146a my-image
    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker run -ti my-image
    root@53dcc08d80b6:/# ls -l imp*
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 22 09:04 importantfile.txt

`docker commit` can also take the container name instead of the ID, like in most docker commands, and the image can be assigned directly instead of using `docker tag`:

`docker commit happy_poitras my-images-2`


### Run processes in containers

 `docker run`

- containers have a main process
- the container stops when that process stops
- containerse can have names
- give the container a name with --name option for easier access later

Containers can be deleted automatically when the main process exits / the container stops using the `--rm` option:

Example: start a container that just sleeps for 5 seconds (`-ti` just so we can see it) and then stops and is deleted:

`docker run --rm ubuntu sleep 5`

Running multiple consecuitive commands:

`docker run -ti ubuntu bash -c "sleep 3;  echo all done"`

Detach a container and leave it running in the background using `-d`; use `bash -c "command -options ..."` instead of just `command -options ...`, otherwise it will not go immediately back to the hosts command line (why?).

`docker run -d -ti ubuntu bash`

This will display the container ID which can be used to "log in" to the container again (the containers name can also be used):

`docker attach [id or name]`

    pk@pk-lightshow:~/projects/lynda/learning_docker$ docker run -d -ti ubuntu bash
    941477002f218e22001a4a67622b6742bad56ae15b829a76ddb25b0de6ce8808
    pk@pk-lightshow:~/projects/lynda/learning_docker$ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
    941477002f21   ubuntu    "bash"    6 seconds ago   Up 6 seconds             lucid_hermann
    pk@pk-lightshow:~/projects/lynda/learning_docker$ docker attach lucid_hermann 
    root@941477002f21:/# exit

When inside a running container, the key sequence `strg-p, strg-q` will exit the container but keep it running in the background.

`docker exec`

- starts another process in an existing container
- great for debugging and DB administration
- can't add ports, volumes etc

E.g. create a shell in a running container with id 424f*:

`docker exec -ti 424f bash`

When the original process is exited / dies, the attached process is exited as well.

### Manage containers

#### Looking at container output

`docker logs` can be used to output the stdout of an exited container:


    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker run --name example -d ubuntu bash -c "lose /etc/password"
    4b8deb5317f901fa53d844d96f404a5ecd5872d7b5e482c08c08dacac3600190
    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker logs example 
    bash: lose: command not found

#### Stopping and removing containers

Killing a running container puts it into stop state.

`docker kill [container name]`

Remove the container:

`docker rm [container name]`

#### Resource constraints

`docker run --memory [maximum-allowed-memory]`
`docker run --cpu-shares [relative to other containers in %]`
`docker run --cpu-quota [hard limit in %]`

Ressouce constraints are generally required by container orchestration solutions.

#### Lessons from the field:

- don't let containers fetch dependencies when they start (e.g. node fetching its dependencies). Risk (besides longer start up time): dependencies might be removed from the repo later. Include all dependencies inside
- don't leave important things in unnamed stopped containers

### Exposing ports

- programs in containers are isolated from the internet by default (e.g., a simple container started with `docker run -ti ubuntu` can't `apt-get install` anything by default)
- containers can be grouped into "private" networks
- you explicitly choose who can connect to whom
- expose ports to let connections in
- private networks to connect between containers

#### Exposing a specific port

- use `-p hostport:containerport` (for **p**ublish) to expose port(s)
- multiple `-p` options can be used:

Example:

Start a server that uses nc (**n**et**c**at) to listen to connection on one port and outputting it to another (ubuntu14.04 includes `nc`, the latest one doesn't):


    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker run --rm -ti -p 45678:45678 -p 45679:45679 --name echo-server ubuntu:14.04 bash
    root@37d5d1da6892:/# nc -lp 45678 | nc -lp 456789

Docker can expose ports dynamically; if only one port is specified, e.g. `-p 3000`, the *HOST* machines port is chose automatically from the unused ports. This allows many containers running programs with fixed ports. This is often used with a service discovery program, e.g. in kubernetes.

**THE QUIZ SAYS ASSIGNING ONLY ONE PORT ASSIGNS IT TO THE SAME PORT ON THE HOST, BUT RANDOM IS TRUE**

These can be found using `docker port [container name or id]` or `docker ps`

    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker run --rm -d -p 45678 -p45679 --name echo-server ubuntu:14.04 bash -c "nc -lp 45678 | nc -lp 45679"6029d9730acf038587332ae520477d0e4da155a4a2d99a1675f9088ec7ec4515
    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                                                          NAMES
    6029d9730acf   ubuntu:14.04   "bash -c 'nc -lp 456â€¦"   8 seconds ago   Up 7 seconds   0.0.0.0:49162->45678/tcp, :::49162->45678/tcp, 0.0.0.0:49161->45679/tcp, :::49161->45679/tcp   echo-server
    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker port echo-server 
    45678/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:49162
    45678/tcp -> :::49162
    45679/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:49161
    45679/tcp -> :::49161

#### Exposing UDP ports

`docker run -p outside-port:inside-port/protocol (tcp/udp)`, e.g. `docker run -p 1234:1234/udp`

### Container networking

By exposing ports, containers can connect to each other *over the host network*:

![network over host](readme_images/network_over_host.png)

More efficient would be if the containers connected directly over the virtual network:

![network over host](readme_images/network_direct.png)

Docker networks can be shown using `docker network ls`:

    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker network ls
    NETWORK ID     NAME                     DRIVER    SCOPE
    bd13faa49809   bridge                   bridge    local
    36c3f2e24bbd   fullstack_default        bridge    local
    bfa7753b3fe7   host                     host      local
    e188b3fe8f7d   none                     null      local
    b111637ac485   phpdocker_test_default   bridge    local
    64abf14af77a   phpworkshop_default      bridge    local

- bridge: default for containers that don't specify any other network
- host: container doesn't have any network isolation at all
- none: no networking

A network can be created using 

`docker network create [network name]`

Containers can be attached to those networks using `--net`:

`docker run --rm -ti --net learning --name catserver ubuntu:14.04 bash`

It is especially important / useful to give the container a name as the containers can refer to each other using those names.

Containers can be on **multiple networks**

For the examples below, we first create a network with the name "learning":

    docker network create [network name]

Terminal 1 (pinging itself just to check):

    docker run --rm -ti --net learning --name catserver ubuntu:14.04 bash
    root@9e07fce74450:/# ping catserver
    PING catserver (172.21.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 9e07fce74450 (172.21.0.2): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.039 ms

Terminal 2 (pinging catserver from dogserver):

    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker run --rm -ti --net learning --name dogserver ubuntu:14.04 bash
    root@20d2d264045c:/# ping catserver
    PING catserver (172.21.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from catserver.learning (172.21.0.2): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.106 ms

Create another network only for cats and put catserver on it (on a host terminal):

    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker network create catsonly
    09a32d8f6227d9cc5e5795de693405b306c8d96ff5777daaabcec9da7b16d449
    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker network connect catsonly catserver

Terminal 3 (adding another cat to catserver):

    pk@pk-lightshow:~$ docker run --rm -ti --net catsonly --name bobcatserver ubuntu:14.04 bash
    root@017a1a934b71:/# ping catserver
    PING catserver (172.22.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from catserver.catsonly (172.22.0.2): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.169 ms
    ...
    root@017a1a934b71:/# ping dogserver
    ping: unknown host dogserver
    root@017a1a934b71:/# 

Here, catserver and dogserver can still connect to each other, catserver can connect to bobcatserver but dogserver can't connect to bobcatserver.

### Legacy linking (avoid)

- Links all ports, but only one way
- environment variables are shared (but only one way)
- depends on startup order
- restarts only sometimes break the links
- usage: `docker run --link catserver [...]`

Sidenote: environment variables can be passed to containers using the `-e` option, e.g.

`docker run -e SECRET=verysecretthing [...]`

### Images

`docker images` lists existing images. Images with the same ID share just one image (under different names), so they don't take up as much space as it looks.

#### Tagging images

- tagging gives images names
- `docker commit [containerid] [desired name]:[tag (optional, default: "latest")]` tags images for you.

Example of name structure (leave out unneeded parts):

`registry.example.com:port/organization/image-name:version-tag`

`Organization/image-name` is often enough.

#### Getting images

`docker pull [image]` pulls an image; it's run automatically by `docker run`. Might be useful for offline work.

#### Cleaning up

- delete a single image: `docker rmi [image-name:tag or image-id]` 
- delete all images, containers, volumes and networks that are dangling / not associated with a container: `docker system prune` 
- also remove any stopped containers: `docker system prune -a` 
- Remove all exited containers: `docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q)`
- Remove all images:`docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)`

### Volumes

#### Sharing data between host and container

- virtual "discs" to store and share data, or rather a shared folder that is mapped between the container and the host.
- two main varieties:
  - persistent
  - ephemeral (only exist as long as they're used by a container)
- not part of images

The shared folder can be indicated by using `-v` with `docker run`. Note that the **abosulute path of the folder is necessary**, so `-v ./example_share` or `-v example_share` will not work.

It is, like with ports, followed by `:` and the desired path on the host system.

    docker run -ti -v /home/pk/projects/lynda/learning_docker/example_share:/shared-folder ubuntu bash

This works also with a single file instead of a folder. In this case, the file must exist before the container is started or it will be assumed to be a directory.

#### Sharing data between containers

- `volumes-from`
- only exist as long as they are being used
- can be shared between containers

These are created by using just the path of the folder in the container:

    docker run --rm -ti -v /shared-data --name vol1 ubuntu bash

The folder can then be shared with other containers using `--volumes-from`:

    docker run --rm -ti --volumes-from vol1 ubuntu bash

The shared-data folder will now be accessible in the newly created container. This can be done will multiple containers and daisy chained (a third container can "inherit" from the second container using `--volumes-from` and doesn't have to reference the "original" one).

### Docker registries

Docker images are retrieved from registries. Registries manage and distribute images. You can your own registry as well.

#### Finding images

- `docker search [keyword]`
- [hub.docker.com](http://hub.docker.com) with more information on how to use the container
- images under http://hub.docker.com/_/[...] are official / generally safe containers 

#### Creating / uploading images

- Login using the command line using `docker login`
- tag the image using `docker tag imagename:[version] [login name]/[new image name]:[version]`
- push it to the registry using `docker push [login name]/[new image name]:[version]`

**these images are public and can be used by anyone**

Tips:

- clean up images regularly
- push containers you really need in case they get deleted by the party providing them
- be aware of who created the containers
